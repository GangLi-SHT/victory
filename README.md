Victory is an efficient implantation of the Parquet equation for the single-band Hubbard model. It fully respects the periodic and anti-periodic boundary condition of the parquet equation in momentum and frequency spaces. Currently the following feasures are implemented:

(1) Both 1D and 2D calculations of the Hubbard model with on-site Coulomb interactions.

(2) Single-band Hubbard model on ladder, square, and triangluar lattices. 

(3) Efficient use of memory, currently a 4 x 4 square lattice study is feasible.

(4) Both single- and two-particle quantities can be equally obtained. 

(5) Channel instability is interpreted as the divergence of the corresponding eigenvalue, which is useful for analyzing phase transitions.

(6) Density of states can be obtained after supplementing with analytical continuation.
